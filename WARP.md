# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a mock project created for development and testing purposes. The project is currently in its initial state with minimal structure.

## Current Structure

```
mock_project/
├── README.md
├── src/           # Empty source directory
├── .gitignore     # Standard ignore patterns for various technologies
└── WARP.md        # This file
```

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project without a specific technology stack, the development setup will depend on what gets added to the project. The `.gitignore` file suggests this project may support multiple technology stacks including Node.js, general build tools, and IDE configurations.

## Common Commands

Currently, there are no build, test, or development commands as the project doesn't have a defined technology stack yet.

When a technology stack is chosen, this section should be updated with:
- Build commands
- Test commands
- Linting/formatting commands
- Development server commands

## Architecture Notes

The project currently has:
- An empty `src/` directory ready for source code
- A comprehensive `.gitignore` covering common development artifacts
- Git repository initialized

As the project evolves, this section should document:
- Chosen technology stack and framework
- Key architectural decisions
- Module/component organization patterns
- Configuration management approach
